### 287. Find the Duplicate Number 
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

### 844. Backspace String Compare

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.
Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
```

### 217. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

### 268. Missing Number

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
